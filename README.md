Thanks to whoever made http://www.reciperoulette.tv/ so I could randomly get recipes in convenient JSON format.

I tried doing this with https://allrecipes.com but it was not easy/fast to pull readable, real recipes.
But I have a script running to pull data from their site and might just make a lil' database to pull from with this repo.
